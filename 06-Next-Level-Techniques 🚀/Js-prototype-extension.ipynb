    "# Creating Custom Methods in JavaScript using prototypes\n",
    "\n",
    "Hey there, curious coder! Today, we're going to explore the enchanting world of custom methods in JavaScript. Imagine you have a special mission: to find the true length of a string without using the regular `trim` method. Let's dive into this adventure and learn how to inject our own magic into JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Quest\n",
    "\n",
    "In our quest for string clarity, we often encounter extra spaces that we wish to remove. The conventional `trim` method does the job, but what if we want to uncover the true length without using it? That's where our custom method, let's call it `trueLength`, comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Enchanting Code\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// Imagine you're on a magical coding journey\n",
    "let wizardStrings = [\"spell\", \"magic\", \"potions\"];\n",
    "\n",
    "let magicBook = {\n",
    "    spell: \"abracadabra\",\n",
    "    magic: \"levitation\",\n",
    "    potions: \"invisibility\",\n",
    "\n",
    "    castSpell: function(spell){\n",
    "        console.log(`Casting ${this[spell]} spell!`);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Our magical method to reveal the true length\n",
    "String.prototype.trueLength = function(){\n",
    "    console.log(`${this}`);\n",
    "    console.log(`The real length is: ${this.trim().length}`);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unveiling the TrueLength Spell\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Creating the TrueLength Spell:**\n",
    "   Let's craft a magical method, the `trueLength` spell, that reveals the true essence of a string without using the regular `trim` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   String.prototype.trueLength = function(){\n",
    "       console.log(`${this}`);\n",
    "       console.log(`The real length is: ${this.trim().length}`);\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Casting Spells with the Wizard:**\n",
    "   Now, imagine you're a wizard and you want to cast spells. You can use the `castSpell` method from the `magicBook`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   magicBook.castSpell(\"spell\");\n",
    "   magicBook.castSpell(\"magic\");\n",
    "   magicBook.castSpell(\"potions\");\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying the TrueLength Spell\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Revealing the True Length:**\n",
    "   - Imagine a scenario where you wish to find the true length of a string without using the `trim` method. Use the `trueLength` spell.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   let enchantedString = \"    JavaScript is amazing     \";\n",
    "   enchantedString.trueLength(); // Outputs: \"JavaScript is amazing\" & \"The real length is: 23\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Magical Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this simple guide, you've discovered the art of injecting custom methods into JavaScript prototypes. By crafting the `trueLength` spell, you've unlocked a magical way to find the true length of strings without relying on the standard `trim` method. Now, you can cast spells and reveal the true essence of strings. Congratulations, you've completed your quest!"
