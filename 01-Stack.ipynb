    "Stack Memory in JavaScript:\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In JavaScript, memory management involves two main components: the stack and the heap. The stack is a region of memory that is used for storing primitive data types, function calls, and local variables. Understanding how the stack works is crucial for optimizing code performance and avoiding stack overflow errors. In this guide, we'll explore the fundamentals of stack memory in JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack Memory Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The stack is a region of memory that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It is used for managing function calls, local variables, and storing data in a structured manner. Each time a function is called, a new frame is added to the stack to store information related to that function's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing Primitive Data Types on the Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "Primitive data types, such as numbers, strings, and booleans, are typically stored directly on the stack when they are declared inside a function or block scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function exampleFunction() {\n",
    "    let numberVar = 42; // Stored on the stack\n",
    "    let stringVar = \"Hello\"; // Also stored on the stack\n",
    "    // ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, both `numberVar` and `stringVar` are stored on the stack because they are local variables within the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Calls and the Call Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "The call stack is a critical component of stack memory, managing the order of function calls and their respective execution contexts. When a function is called, a new frame is pushed onto the call stack, and when the function completes, its frame is popped off the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function outerFunction() {\n",
    "    innerFunction(); // Call to innerFunction\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "function innerFunction() {\n",
    "    // Code for innerFunction\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "outerFunction(); // Call to outerFunction\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the call stack maintains the order of function calls: first `outerFunction`, then `innerFunction`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion and the Call Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion, where a function calls itself, is a common use of the call stack. It's important to manage the depth of recursion to prevent stack overflow errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function recursiveFunction(counter) {\n",
    "    if (counter <= 0) {\n",
    "        return;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    recursiveFunction(counter - 1);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "recursiveFunction(5); // Recursive function call\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this recursive example, each call to `recursiveFunction` adds a new frame to the stack until the base case is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack Memory Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The stack has a limited size, and exceeding this limit results in a stack overflow error. This limitation is an important consideration when dealing with recursive functions or deeply nested function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Stack and Heap image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1358/1*MGWjm0T03WGo43CqVjRwTQ.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding stack memory in JavaScript is fundamental for writing efficient and error-free code. By grasping how the stack manages function calls, local variables, and primitive data types, developers can optimize their code for better performance and avoid common pitfalls associated with stack overflow errors."
