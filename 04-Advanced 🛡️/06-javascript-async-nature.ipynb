    "# Mastering Asynchronous JavaScript: A Journey Through Promises and Async/Await\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript, as a single-threaded language, handles asynchronous operations using promises and introduces modern concepts like async/await. This guide explores the intricacies of asynchronous programming in JavaScript, covering promises, async functions, and practical use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Promises: A Foundation for Asynchrony\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Promise\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const promiseOne = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n",
    "    setTimeout(function() {\n",
    "        console.log('Async task is complete');\n",
    "        resolve();\n",
    "    }, 1000);\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "promiseOne.then(function() {\n",
    "    console.log(\"Promise consumed\");\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chaining Promises\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const promiseFour = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n",
    "    setTimeout(function() {\n",
    "        let error = true;\n",
    "        if (!error) {\n",
    "            resolve({ username: \"ZeeshanMukhtar1\", password: \"123\" });\n",
    "        } else {\n",
    "            reject('ERROR: Something went wrong');\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }, 1000);\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "promiseFour\n",
    "    .then((user) => {\n",
    "        console.log(user);\n",
    "        return user.username;\n",
    "    })\n",
    "    .then((username) => {\n",
    "        console.log(username);\n",
    "    })\n",
    "    .catch(function(error) {\n",
    "        console.log(error);\n",
    "    })\n",
    "    .finally(() => console.log(\"The promise is either resolved or rejected\"));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Promise Conventions: Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Promises use `resolve` for successful execution and `reject` for errors. It's essential to handle errors using the `.catch` method or the second argument of `.then`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Async/Await: A More Readable Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Async Function\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const promiseFive = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n",
    "    setTimeout(function() {\n",
    "        let error = true;\n",
    "        if (!error) {\n",
    "            resolve({ username: \"javascript\", password: \"123\" });\n",
    "        } else {\n",
    "            reject('ERROR: JS went wrong');\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }, 1000);\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "async function consumePromiseFive() {\n",
    "    try {\n",
    "        const response = await promiseFive;\n",
    "        console.log(response);\n",
    "    } catch (error) {\n",
    "        console.log(error);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "consumePromiseFive();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Example: Fetching Data\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "async function fetchData() {\n",
    "    try {\n",
    "        const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');\n",
    "        const data = await response.json();\n",
    "        console.log(data);\n",
    "    } catch (error) {\n",
    "        console.log(\"Error fetching data:\", error);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fetchData();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### JSON Conversion Time Consideration\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with large data sets, the time taken for JSON conversion should be considered. Async/await ensures that your application remains responsive during these operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-world Application: GitHub API\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "async function fetchGitHubUser(username) {\n",
    "    try {\n",
    "        const response = await fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${username}`);\n",
    "        const data = await response.json();\n",
    "        console.log(data);\n",
    "    } catch (error) {\n",
    "        console.log(\"Error fetching GitHub user:\", error);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "fetchGitHubUser('ZeeshanMukhtar1');\n",
    "```\n",
    "--- \n",
    "## Interview Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Interviewer: When making a Promise request, where would you receive a 404 error, in the resolve callback or the reject callback?\n",
    "\n",
    "Candidate: A 404 error would be received in the resolve callback. The resolve callback is responsible for handling the successful completion of a Promise, and a 404 error indicates that the request was successful, but the requested resource could not be found. The reject callback is only called if there is an error that prevents the Promise from being fulfilled, such as a network error or an invalid request.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding asynchronous programming in JavaScript is crucial for building efficient and responsive web applications. Promises and async/await simplify complex workflows, allowing developers to create smooth and performant user experiences.\n"
