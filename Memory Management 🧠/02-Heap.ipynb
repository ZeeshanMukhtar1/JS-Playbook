    "A Guide to Heap Memory in JavaScript: Storing Primitive and Non-Primitive Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In JavaScript, memory management is handled automatically by the engine, and developers don't explicitly allocate or deallocate memory. However, understanding heap memory is still crucial for writing efficient code, especially when working with dynamic data structures and managing memory indirectly. In this guide, we'll delve into how heap memory works in JavaScript and explore its role in storing both primitive and non-primitive data types.\n",

    "Heap Memory in JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript uses automatic memory management, and memory allocation for variables is abstracted from developers. The JavaScript engine employs garbage collection to automatically reclaim memory that is no longer in use, making manual memory management unnecessary for developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing Primitive Data Types in Heap Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Primitive data types in JavaScript, such as numbers, strings, and booleans, are stored either on the stack or in special data structures depending on their context. However, when these primitive types are part of objects, they are stored on the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// Storing a primitive data type (number) in an object\n",
    "let numberObject = new Number(42);\n",
    "\n",
    "// Accessing the primitive value\n",
    "let value = numberObject.valueOf();\n",
    "console.log(value);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the number is stored on the heap within the `Number` object. Accessing the primitive value is done using the `valueOf()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing Non-Primitive Data Types in Heap Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-primitive data types, such as arrays and objects, are always stored on the heap in JavaScript. When you create an array or an object, the engine allocates memory on the heap to store the data and automatically manages its lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// Storing a non-primitive data type (array) on the heap\n",
    "let dynamicArray = [1, 2, 3];\n",
    "\n",
    "// Modifying the array\n",
    "dynamicArray.push(4);\n",
    "\n",
    "// The array is stored on the heap, and memory is managed by the engine\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the array `dynamicArray` is stored on the heap, and the engine takes care of memory management, including resizing the array if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory Management in JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "While JavaScript abstracts away many memory management complexities, developers should still be aware of potential memory leaks, especially when working with long-lived objects or closures. Circular references, where objects reference each other, can prevent garbage collection, leading to memory leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// Example of a potential memory leak with circular references\n",
    "let obj1 = {};\n",
    "let obj2 = {};\n",
    "\n",
    "obj1.ref = obj2;\n",
    "obj2.ref = obj1;\n",
    "\n",
    "// Despite going out of scope, these objects won't be garbage collected\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the circular reference between `obj1` and `obj2` can prevent the garbage collector from reclaiming their memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "While JavaScript abstracts much of the complexity of memory management from developers, understanding how heap memory works is still essential for writing efficient and bug-free code. Whether dealing with primitive or non-primitive data types, being mindful of potential memory issues and following best practices ensures that your JavaScript applications are performant and free from memory leaks."
