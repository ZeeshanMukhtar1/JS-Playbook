    "# Understanding Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) in JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In JavaScript, an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) is a design pattern that involves defining and immediately executing a function. This pattern is commonly used to create a private scope for variables and functions, preventing them from polluting the global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use IIFE?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "IIFE allows you to encapsulate code within a function, creating a private scope. This helps in avoiding naming conflicts and unintended variable modifications in the global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Information Hiding\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables and functions defined within an IIFE are not accessible from outside the function, providing a way to hide implementation details and expose only necessary functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Avoiding Global Pollution\n",
    "\n",
    "By executing code immediately within a function, you prevent the creation of unnecessary global variables, making your code more modular and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax of an IIFE involves wrapping a function declaration in parentheses and immediately invoking it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "(function() {\n",
    "    // Your code here\n",
    "})();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Named IIFE\n",
    "\n",
    "A named IIFE has the same structure as an anonymous one but includes a function name. This is useful for self-documenting code and stack trace debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "(function namedIIFE() {\n",
    "    // Your code here\n",
    "})();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameterized IIFE\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also pass parameters to an IIFE, making it versatile for different use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "(function(parameter) {\n",
    "    // Your code here using the parameter\n",
    "})(value);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a scenario where you want to create a counter that is not accessible globally. An IIFE is a perfect choice for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const counterModule = (function() {\n",
    "    let count = 0;\n",
    "\n",
    "    return {\n",
    "        increment: function() {\n",
    "            count++;\n",
    "        },\n",
    "        getCount: function() {\n",
    "            return count;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    };\n",
    "})();\n",
    "\n",
    "counterModule.increment();\n",
    "console.log(counterModule.getCount()); // Output: 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `count` variable is encapsulated within the IIFE, and the module exposes only the necessary functionalities.\n"

    "DatabaseConnection.disconnect(); // Output: Disconnecting from the database... \\n Database disconnected!\n",
    "console.log(DatabaseConnection.isConnected()); // Output: false\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The IIFE encapsulates the database connection logic, including private variables (`isConnected`), private methods (`connectToDatabase` and `disconnectFromDatabase`), and a public API (returned object with `isConnected`, `performDatabaseOperation`, `connect`, and `disconnect` methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `connect` and `disconnect` methods simulate the process of connecting to and disconnecting from a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `performDatabaseOperation` method checks if the database is connected before performing an operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `isConnected` method allows you to check the current connection status.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how an IIFE can be used to create a modular and encapsulated database connection module in JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "IIFE is a valuable JavaScript pattern that aids in creating modular, encapsulated, and efficient code. It's especially useful in scenarios where you need to avoid global pollution and maintain a clean and organized codebase. Understanding and applying IIFE will enhance your ability to write more robust and scalable JavaScript applications."
