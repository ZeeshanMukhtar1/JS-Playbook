    "## Event Bubbling and Event Capturing in JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "Event bubbling and event capturing are two phases of the event propagation process in the Document Object Model (DOM). Understanding these phases is crucial for effective event handling in web development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Event Bubbling\n",
    "\n",
    "Event bubbling is the default phase of event propagation in which the event starts from the target element that triggered it and bubbles up through its ancestors in the DOM hierarchy. This means that the innermost element's event handler is executed first, followed by its parent's, and so on, until it reaches the root of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate event bubbling:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html lang=\"en\">\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n",
    "    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">\n",
    "    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n",
    "    <title>Event Bubbling Example</title>\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "<body>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <div id=\"parent\">\n",
    "    <button id=\"child\">Click me</button>\n",
    "  </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <script>\n",
    "    const parent = document.getElementById('parent');\n",
    "    const child = document.getElementById('child');\n",
    "\n",
    "    parent.addEventListener('click', function() {\n",
    "      console.log('Parent clicked!');\n",
    "    });\n",
    "\n",
    "    child.addEventListener('click', function() {\n",
    "      console.log('Child clicked!');\n",
    "    });\n",
    "  </script>\n",
    "\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, clicking the button triggers both the child and parent click events due to event bubbling. The output in the console will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Child clicked!\n",
    "Parent clicked!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Event Capturing\n",
    "\n",
    "Event capturing, also known as trickling, is the opposite of event bubbling. In this phase, the event starts from the root of the document and trickles down through the DOM hierarchy until it reaches the target element. Event capturing allows you to intercept events before they reach the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use event capturing, you set the third parameter of the `addEventListener` method to `true`. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html lang=\"en\">\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n",
    "    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">\n",
    "    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n",
    "    <title>Event Capturing Example</title>\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "<body>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <div id=\"parent\">\n",
    "    <button id=\"child\">Click me</button>\n",
    "  </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <script>\n",
    "    const parent = document.getElementById('parent');\n",
    "    const child = document.getElementById('child');\n",
    "\n",
    "    parent.addEventListener('click', function() {\n",
    "      console.log('Parent clicked!');\n",
    "    }, true);\n",
    "\n",
    "    child.addEventListener('click', function() {\n",
    "      console.log('Child clicked!');\n",
    "    }, true);\n",
    "  </script>\n",
    "\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, clicking the button triggers both the parent and child click events due to event capturing. The output in the console will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Parent clicked!\n",
    "Child clicked!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Event Bubbling vs. Event Capturing\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision to use event bubbling or capturing depends on the specific requirements of your application. Most commonly, event bubbling is used as it aligns with the natural flow of user interactions from the target element up to its ancestors. However, in scenarios where you need to intercept events before they reach the target, event capturing can be a useful tool.\n",
