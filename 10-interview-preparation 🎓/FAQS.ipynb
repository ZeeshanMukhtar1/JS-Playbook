    "What is the nature of JavaScript in terms of being a single-threaded or multi-threaded language, and how does it handle concurrency?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "JavaScript is single-threaded, executing one operation at a time. It achieves concurrency through mechanisms like callbacks, promises, and async/await. Multi-threaded languages can execute multiple threads simultaneously, but JavaScript can use web APIs like Web Workers for parallel processing.\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "The purpose of JavaScript is to enable dynamic and interactive behavior on websites. It's a scripting language that runs in web browsers, allowing developers to create responsive user interfaces, handle user input, and manipulate the content of web pages in real-time. JavaScript is versatile and widely used for both client-side and server-side development, making it a fundamental technology for building modern web applications\n",

    "    });\n",
    "  });\n",
    "});\n",
